# Hecto 
Hecto is a CLI based text editor, similar to Vim and Emacs. The editor supports syntax highlighting for rust, functionalities like saving, editing existing file and so on.

To run the editor, you can run this from the root folder to open the base editor:
```rust
cargo run
```

Or, you can open a file from the root folder:
```rust
cargo run ./path/to/file/relative/to/root
```

The status bar at the bottom will always display the available commands for any given moment.
